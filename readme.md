# Advent of Code 2017


This is my solutions for [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) 2017.

## Goal
I will try to use as few lines as possible, with the goal of achiving the solution in only one line. 

## Structure
Folders corresponds to dates in december, each contain two python files (part1.py part2.py) and usually txt with input data

## Run
The solutions is written in [Python2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2714/).
By design each script will look for input data relative to where it is started from, and it needs to be started in its days folder.
This is to reduce the number of lines needed in the script, while still have a nice project structure.

```python
cd dayX
python partY.py
```
